## Data Selection:
  ### Features we have selected: 
    1. age
    2. sex
    3. pclass
    4. sibsp (Siblings and Spouses)
    5. embarked
    6. parch (Parents and Children)
    

##  Reasons why following features have been rejected:
    1. Cabin: 
              While this has a pretty good Correlation Coefficient values (r), we have removed this feature to more nAn values
    2. PassengerId: Doesn't matter
    3. Fare: 
    4. Ticket:
    5. Name: 
    6. Name_Title: 
              This was initially created to contribute to the analyse the Survival rates of Nobility over the working class. But removed due to low Correlation Coefficient (r) values
